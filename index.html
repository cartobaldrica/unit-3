                <h3>Land use in Milwaukee's neighborhoods</h3>
                <p>Every neighborhood is different. Some are sprawling subdivisions of single-family homes, while others combine commercial, green space, and apartment buildings. 
                    Zoning provides some insight into these differences, but often neglects de facto land usage, such as roads, or highways.
                    This map combines zoning code data with with de facto land use to paint a picture of each of Milwaukee's neighborhoods. Milwaukee is known as one, if not
                    the, most segregated city in America, and this land use dataset shows how differences are carved onto the land itself.</p>
